# connectiq-bergsteigen-datafield-1
A DataField for Garmin Smart Watches intended as a first page (1-Field-Layout) for mountain tours.

For my DataField intended for the second page see rgrellmann/connectiq-bergsteigen-datafield-2

This is a DataField which can be added to activity apps on Garmin smartwatches.
Currently it is only working on the v√≠voactive 3 series.
Currently only english and german translations are available.

This DataField contains informations which are of permanent interest during mountain tours, and should be easily readable while walking or climbing.
* current altitiude
* current heart rate
* total ascent and total descent (in my opinion the ascent and descent are more important during mountain tours than the elapsed distance, which can be found on DataField 2)
* elapsed time
* battery status icon
* current clock time
